#I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

Errr... I mean, this is a repository for messing around with stuff around chess. 
It will have a model game, and basic playability. I would like to eventually mess
around with programming AI stuff.

It's a C project with a makefile. It's about as straightforward as you can get.
To build, type in make. To run, type make run.
