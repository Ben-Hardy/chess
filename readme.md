#I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

Errr... I mean, this is a repository for messing around with stuff around chess. 
It will have a model game, and basic playability. I would like to eventually mess
around with programming AI stuff.

I initially worked on this in C but I thought of some easier ways to go about this so I redid it in Java. Also lets me use JUnit tests, which make building this kind of thing much, much easier.

The program is an Eclipse project right now. The easiest way to use it is to open it in Eclipse.


### ***OLD VERSION ***

It's a C project with a makefile. It's about as straightforward as you can get.
To build, type in make. To run, type make run.
